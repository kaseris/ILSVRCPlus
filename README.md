# ILSVRCPlus
Implementations of Deep Convolution Neural Networks for Image classification, train on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Tiny Imagenet

## Objectives
This repository is dedicated to construct and train various deep architectures used for image classification. More specifically, the goals for this repository are listed below:

* Construct a VGG Network
  * Construct a VGG-like architecture for training on MNIST
  * Construct a VGG-like architecture for training on CIFAR-10
  * Construct the original architecture, as mentioned in [[1]]("1").

* Construct a GoogLeNet Network
  * Construct a GoogLeNet variant for training on MNIST dataset.
  * Construct a GoogLeNet variant for training on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  * Construct the original architecture, as mentioned in [[2]]("2").
  
 * Report training and testing results
